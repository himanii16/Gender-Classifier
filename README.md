#INPUT: 
Image of a person
#OUTPUT: 
0 (male)  and  1 (female)

# Programming Language :
Python

# Libraries and machine learning frameworks used :
openCV-python, keras, cvlib, numpy, os

# Training:
The program is trained using many images provided by the dataset and then using pre-defined libraries of python such as keras and cvlib, we predicted the gender of the image given.
